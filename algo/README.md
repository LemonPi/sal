Algorithms
====
Everything is under the sal namespace and usage is just by including whichever header you want, no linking required. 

Straightforward implementation of various algorithms in C++,
using conventions of the standard library. 
<br>
All functions taking [begin, end) are overloaded to take containers

Example uses can be found in sal/README or in testing/algotest.cpp, which also includes unit tests
for each algorithm and is interactive.
