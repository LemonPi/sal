Datastructures
===
Everything is under the sal namespace and usage is just by including whichever header you want, no linking required. 

Simple implementations of efficient data structures.
Some highlights include the Treap implementation, which is 4x faster at insertion and 2x faster at
find when used as a set or map as compared to the standard library.

Example uses can be found in sal/README or in testing/datatest.cpp, which also includes unit tests
for each data structure.
